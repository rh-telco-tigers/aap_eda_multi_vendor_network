# Ansible Event-Driven Multi-Vendor Network Automation

This repository contains an Ansible event-driven framework for automating network configurations across multiple vendor devices. The solution leverages Ansibleâ€™s extensible nature to provide a standardized way to automate network tasks, respond to events, and manage diverse network infrastructure.

## Overview

This project enables network engineers to manage multi-vendor network devices using event-driven automation. By defining events, triggers, and actions, the framework allows for responsive and automated network operations such as configuration changes, monitoring, and alerting.
Features

    Event-Driven Automation: Execute specific tasks based on defined events and triggers.
    Multi-Vendor Support: Manage devices from various vendors using a unified Ansible playbook structure.
    Modular and Extensible: Easily extend support for additional vendors and network features.
    Logging and Alerting: Built-in support for logging actions and alerting based on event outcomes.
    Scalability: Suitable for small to large network environments.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed and configured:

    Ansible >= 2.9
    Python >= 3.6
    Network device credentials stored securely (e.g., Ansible Vault, environment variables)
    Ansible collections for each supported vendor (e.g., cisco.ios, arista.eos, junipernetworks.junos)
